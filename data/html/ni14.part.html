		When Chicagoan&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/">Chance
			the Rapper</a>&nbsp;delivered his verse on "<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17987-kanye-west-ultralight-beam-ft-chance-the-rapper-the-dream-kelly-price-and-kirk-franklin/">Ultralight
			Beam</a>," the opening song&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>'s&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21542-the-life-of-pablo/">The
				Life of Pablo</a></em>, there was a lot going on&mdash;sly homage was being
		paid to West; rappers were being put on notice ("This is my
		part/Nobody else speak"); and, most importantly, Chance was
		encapsulating his past, asserting his present, and telegraphing his
		future. He was finally positioning&nbsp;himself as a rapper to be
		reckoned with from a mainstream podium, but he was also delving deep
		into Christian ideology, with allusions to Noah's Ark and Lot's wife,
		with his "foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea."
	</p>
	<p>
		That verse rolled out the red carpet for Kanye's long-awaited album,
		but it doubled&nbsp;as an announcement of Chance's new&nbsp;<em>Coloring
			Book&nbsp;(then given the working title&nbsp;Chance 3),</em>&nbsp;which
		may very well be the most eagerly-anticipated hip-hop project this
		year that doesn't come attached to an actual record label. West billed
		his album as "a gospel album with a whole lot of cursing on it,"
		but&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;wasn't that; it was a rap
		album with some gospel overtures.&nbsp;<em>Coloring Book</em>,
		however, fits the billing, packing in so much gospel verve that it
		sounds like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-EhvSlHyZg"
			target="_blank">Hezekiah Walker &amp; the Love Fellowship Crusade
			Choir</a>are going to drop into half the tracks and recite 1 Timothy 4:12
		in chorale. Instead, we get&nbsp;<a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Franklin" target="_blank">Kirk
			Franklin</a>&nbsp;promising to lead us into the Promised Land, alongside
		appearances by demonstrated materialistic heathens like&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/">2 Chainz</a>,&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/">Lil Wayne</a>,&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/">Young Thug</a>,
		and&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/">Future</a>&mdash;and
		the result is an uplifting mix that even an atheist can catch the
		Spirit to.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thematically, *Coloring Book *is a far cry from Chance's previous
		efforts. His debut mixtape,&nbsp;<em>10 Day</em>, was a small,
		heavy-lidded odyssey of being suspended from high school&nbsp;"for
		chiefin' a hundred blunts;" his breakthrough, 2013's dilated&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/">Acid
				Rap</a>**,</em>&nbsp;contained songs about being a "Chain Smoker" and
		confessions of "cigarettes on cigarettes/My momma think I stank/I got
		burn-holes in my hoodies." But here, on&nbsp;<em>Coloring Book</em>,
		Chancelor Bennett observes&nbsp;that "we don't do the same drugs no
		more" over acoustic piano and choristers backing his sentiments. He
		says<a
			href="https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/731262639888830464"
			target="_blank">&nbsp;the song is not about drugs</a>, but it still
		comes off as a sobering admission from a rapper who once dedicated a
		small travelogue to<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoWL9JkBhKA" target="_blank">&nbsp;taking
			acid south of the U.S. border</a>.
	</p>
	<p>"Music is all we got," Chance professes on "All We Got," the
		inaugural number featuring the Chicago Children's Choir and West
		returning the "Ultralight Beam" favor&mdash;but it's clear from the
		outset that this is Chance's show. His vocals&mdash;elastic and taut,
		all jerky grace, full of word-sound collages that hearken back to his
		spoken-word genealogy&mdash; are now almost fully dedicated to God and
		being high on life. "I get my Word from the sermon/I do not talk to
		the serpent/That's a holistic discernment," he raps before threatening
		to "give Satan a swirly." Although his&nbsp;puerility remains intact,
		his fervor is amplified as never before.</p>
	<p>
		On "<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18249-chance-the-rapper-blessings/">Blessings</a>,"
		poet-activist-singer-songwriter&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33738-jamila-woods/">Jamila
			Woods</a>&nbsp;comes through with the hook: "I'm gon' praise Him/Praise
		Him 'til I'm gone," while Chance drops sanctified tweetables: "I don't
		make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom/Don't believe in kings,
		believe in the Kingdom" and "Jesus' black life ain't matter/I know, I
		talk to his daddy." He also manages to mix in heavenly faith,
		&nbsp;the joy of fatherhood, and redemption in a couplet and a half:
		"I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions/Like my
		ex-girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything/I'm at war
		with my wrongs." It's a heavy message delivered lightly, with tongue
		aflame.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Coloring Book</em>&nbsp;is not all about&nbsp;transcendence,
		however. Despite asking "when did you start to forget how to fly?,"
		Chance still has his feet firmly planted&nbsp;as one of the biggest
		independent rappers of the moment. On "No Problem" he raps, "If one
		more label try to stop me/It's gon' be some dread-head n-ggas in your
		lobby." (In a sublime stroke, the song features Lil Wayne, stretching
		and compacting his flow to approximate Chance's delivery while
		speaking on his own ongoing contractual issues with Cash Money
		Records.) "Mixtape" features Young Thug and&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33587-lil-yachty/">Lil Yachty</a>&mdash;two
		rappers who have found growing success by upending traditional music
		industry norms like Chance&mdash;to speak on their outsider stances.
		Thug doesn't get specific enough to make the song as heavy as it might
		have been, but Yachty's verse is strong ("Time and time again they
		told me no/They told me I wouldn't go&hellip;/Fuck them reviews that
		they put in the paper/Did what I wanted, didn't care about a
		hater/Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer") and helps the hook
		shine through: "Am I the only one who still cares about mixtapes?"
		(It's worth noting that Chance, who has never released a project for
		sale before, also<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/60521-chance-the-rapper-and-lil-b-release-free-based-freestyles-mixtape/">released
			a real-time mixtape last year with fellow outlier Lil B.</a>)

	<p>
		The bars here are so hard that it ain't one gosh-darned part you can't
		tweet, but the tracks carry their weight like their brother's keeper.
		"Summer Friends" hisses with soft humidity; &nbsp;"Juke Jam" is the
		soundtrack to a candle-lit bedroom; "All Night" moves its feet to
		Chicago house, courtesy of a roller-rink jam from&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/31672-kaytranada/">Kaytranada</a>.
		But the bulk of this record is handled by musical ensemble the&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32988-donnie-trumpet-the-social-experiment/">Social
			Experiment</a>. They're Chance's trusted collaborators&mdash;together
		they released last year's&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20664-surf/">Surf</a></em>,
		spearheaded by&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32978-donnie-trumpet/">Donnie
			Trumpet</a>*&mdash;*and they've been refining a sound of expansive but
		intimate live jazz-indebted soul for the past few years. Here, they
		take listeners to church with organs on "How Great," steel drums on
		"Angels," and choirs, choirs everywhere. On the "Blessings" reprise
		that closes out the album, there's an<a

		<em>Coloring Book</em>&nbsp;is one of the strongest rap albums
		released this year, and is destined to be on year-end lists aplenty.
		It's a more rewarding listen than&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/">Drake</a>'s
		recently released&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21836-drake-views/">VIEWS</a></em>;
		it's nearly as adventurous as&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo.</em>&nbsp;In
		execution and focus, it comes as a joyful, praise-dancing rejoinder
		to&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/">Kendrick
			Lamar</a>'s *<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/">To
			Pimp a Butterfly</a>**. *It feels a bit silly to compare&nbsp;<em>Coloring
			Book</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Butterfly</em>, but it feels even sillier not
		to. When music comes like this&mdash;personal and panoramic, full of
		conversations with God, defying hip-hop norms while respecting them,
		proving that the genre can still dig deeper into its roots&mdash;it
		needs to be contextualized as what it is. This is an ultralight beam;
		it's a God dream.
