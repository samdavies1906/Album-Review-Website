<p>
	The slogan “more than a Club” expresses the commitment that <strong>Futbol
		Club Barcelona</strong> has maintained and still maintains beyond what belongs
	in the realm of sport. For many years, this commitment specifically
	referred to Catalan society, which for many decades of the 20th century
	lived under dictatorships that persecuted its language and culture.
	Under these circumstances, Barça always supported Catalan sentiments,
	and the defence of its own language and culture.
</p>

<p>It was because of this,even though Catalan was not an official
	language, that in 1921 the club drafted its statutes in the language of
	Catalonia. It was also in this era that in 1918 the club adhered to a
	petition for a statute of autonomy for Catalonia, which was being
	demanded from all sectors of the catalanista movement.</p>

<p>
	The club’s position&nbsp;led to reprisals from the Spanish authorities
	and it was closed down for six months under the <strong>Primo
		de Rivera</strong> dictatorship. During the Second Spanish Republic, the club
	intensified its message of implication with Catalonia’s own culture and
	institutions. President <strong>Josep Suñol</strong> led this process
	using the slogan “sport and citizenship”, the purpose being to imply
	sports in the country’s social and cultural affairs.<br> <br>
	Suñol, who was also a member of parliament, was shot dead early in the
	Spanish Civil War in 1936; and from then on, the Club came to be an
	icon of the defence of the Republic, as shown by the tour of Mexico and
	the United States in 1937. When the Civil War ended, General Franco’s
	dictatorship sought to destroy the club’s social significance.
</p>

<p>
	It enforced the Spanish version of its name and the removal of the four
	Catalan stripes from the badge. Despite the dictatorship’s persistence,
	in the late 1960s the Club started&nbsp;recovering its former
	spirit,&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;the speeches of President Narcís de
	Carreras, the man who coined the famous phrase&nbsp;<strong>“more
		than a Club”</strong> in 1968. Outside of Catalonia, in many parts of Spain,
	Barça also became a symbol&nbsp;of democracy and anti-centralism. When
	democracy returned after the death of Franco, the Club maintained its
	social commitment and new ways of supporting good&nbsp;causes emerged,
	which would later be encompassed by the creation of the Club’s
	Foundation.<br> <br> Now in the age of globalisation, Barça
	has extended its social commitment to the rest of the planet, with a
	specially significant event being the signing of an agreement with <strong>Unicef</strong>
	in 2006, which was a way of saying that a sports club should not be
	marginal to problems going on in society, in this case, the plight of
	children around the world. Because of this, Barça continues to be “more
	than a Club” both in Catalonia and elsewhere in the world, and is
	implied in numerous cultural, social and charity initiatives.
</p>

<p>
	Below we take a look at the four of the defining traits of Futbol Club
	Barcelona.<br> <br> <strong>CATALANISM</strong>: Since its
	very foundation, FC Barcelona has been intrinsically linked to its
	country, Catalonia, a commitment that comes from society as a whole and
	one that is understood by Barça fans in the rest of Spain and in the
	rest of the world. The Club firmly and strongly promotes Catalonia
	around the world. Barça supports an integrated, multicultural, fair and
	caring Catalonia.<br> <br> <strong>UNIVERSALITY:</strong>
	When the Club anthem says ‘it does not matter where you come from’, it
	expresses the spirit of an institution open to everyone, that brings
	together fans from around the five continents and links them to a
	history in which half of the Club’s founders were from outside
	Catalonia. FC Barcelona has members and supporters’ clubs in more than
	50 countries, from Cameroon to China, millions of fans come together to
	make Barça great.<br> <br> <strong>SOCIAL
		COMMITMENT:</strong> Barça is an open club, one that brings people together and
	promotes positive values on a daily basis whether it be via its own
	Foundation, via agreements with international institutions such as
	UNICEF, or via collaborations with local organisations such as ‘Banc
	dels Aliments’. These projects are usually developed in areas such as
	educations, the arts and culture as well as in community support and
	developmental aid.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>DEMOCRACY</strong>:
	The Club members are also its owners and they decide democratically who
	it is that ought to run FC Barcelona. The democratic principle is a
	fundamental pillar of the Club and it has only been neglected when
	dictatorships have intervened. Today Barça is one of the few big
	European clubs that is run democratically, another factor in its unique
	appeal.
