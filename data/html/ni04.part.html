		What the 20-year-old anomaly represents to Hip Hop has always
		overshadowed his actual musical output. His wildly untraditional rap
		style and controversial comments have solely carried any conversation
		regarding both him and his music to the point where his listeners have
		become tribal. Some deem his mumble/twinkle/too-happy rap style a
		punishable crime while others champion its innovation. Either way, the
		spotlight of dispute has plagued the reception to&nbsp;<a

			target="_blank">his mixtapes</a>&nbsp;as well as his debut
		album&nbsp;<em><a

			target="_blank">Teenage Emotions</a></em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		But recently, Lil Xan&nbsp;<a
			href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46280/title.rich-homie-quan-names-lil-xan-as-wackest-in-the-game"
			target="_blank">took the top spot on Hip Hop&rsquo;s Most Wanted
			list</a>&nbsp;and now Lil Yachty finally gets to release&nbsp;<a
			href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46028/title.lil-yachty-announces-release-date-cover-art-for-lil-boat-2"
			target="_blank">his sophomore album,&nbsp;<em>Lil Boat 2</em></a>&nbsp;noticeably
		free of the debate gauntlet. While operating under this proverbial
		hate radar, Yachty doubles down on his eccentrics, getting even
		wackier than before confirming that he strictly does what he wants
		when he wants.
	</p>
	<p>
		What makes&nbsp;<em>Lil Boat 2</em>&nbsp;a lot bumpier of a ride from
		the get-go is the turbulent production. In general, the instrumentals
		are a collision course of sharp hi-hats, thundering 808s and Sci-Fi
		movie sound effects all polished with an Auto-Tune glaze. Charlie
		Shuffler kicks off &ldquo;SELF MADE&rdquo; with an intergalactic
		baseline and trunk rattling bass to which Yachty hits with flex lines
		like &ldquo;Made it out my momma crib, then bought my moms a
		crib/Bought myself a chain, kept it short &rsquo;cause I ain&rsquo;t
		Jibbs/She gon&rsquo; let me fuck, she like that &ldquo;Lil Boat&rdquo;
		adlib/And we at Liv/later I&rsquo;m in her ribs.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>The extraterrestrial vibrations continue throughout the album
		thanks to 30 Roc and his wonky instrumentations. &ldquo;BOOM!&rdquo;
		follows a twisted baseline and reversed chords while &ldquo;BABY
		DADDY&rdquo; is an eerily scant canvas for Yachty, Lil Pump and Offset
		to boast and brag on. Yachty gets props for going with an obvious
		deviation from the formula on any previous projects &ndash; he might
		even scare away some of his sugary-pop-rap fans that have vouched for
		him thus far.</p>
	<p>Lil Boat is Yachty&rsquo;s boastful alter ego that doesn&rsquo;t
		hesitate to stunt his choker diamond necklaces and lavish teenage
		lifestyle. All but two of the 17 songs are brag fests that make Yachty
		seem like Atlanta&rsquo;s supported swag lord. &ldquo;She ready&rdquo;
		(with PnB Rock) and &ldquo;love me forever&rdquo; serve as the pair of
		cuts not performed in Lil Boat mode. The latter record finds Yachty
		taking off his Quality Control battle armor and unraveling passions:
		&ldquo;Love me today/Will you love me today? And love me
		forever.&rdquo; For dramatic effect, the spacey bangers are all
		stylized in uppercase, differentiating them from the sensitive bubble
		gum bops.</p>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s important to note that coming into the project with the
		lofty expectations will leave you lost at sea. There isn&rsquo;t a ton
		of apparent lyrical growth or profound substance but there are a few
		agreeable songs for all audiences like Tee Grizzley-assisted
		&ldquo;GET MONEY BROS.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Lil Boat 2</em>&nbsp;is a
		simply a weird musical vacation that sets sail into the strange mind
		of the impactful red-haired youngster.
