	<p>
		&lsquo;No label, no PR, no publisher&hellip;&rsquo; so goes
		JME&rsquo;s Twitter bio, &lsquo;no meat, no dairy no egg.&rsquo;
		He&rsquo;s an independent artist who abstains from the spoils&nbsp;of
		hedonism. A 16-bar grafter, he&rsquo;s grime&rsquo;s tireless lifer
		with the ethical mettle to safeguard the genre&rsquo;s integrity. And
		it&rsquo;s with this stringent teetotalism that we begin to understand
		the MC&rsquo;s steady ascendancy. Rooted in his Boy Better Know
		enterprise, he spits like the educator of reason; &ldquo;If you want
		something, work towards it.&rdquo; JME works hard, and as&nbsp;<em>Integrity&gt;</em>attests,
		hard work pays off.
	</p>
	<p>Yet while JME preaches over the fruits of veganism and the toils
		of A&amp;R depravity, there is a storming vocal aggression that
		uppercuts the purls&nbsp;of his production. Behind the computer
		console accreditations, the Nazir Mazhar citations and internet meme
		quotes is an unquenched ferocity fuelled by the desire to be
		self-sufficient in an unforgiving social climate.</p>
	<p>
		In&nbsp;<em>Work</em>, JME belittles the luxuries of debauchery while
		celebrating&nbsp;his own morality over a trap-rooted warble and
		industrial clinks. In&nbsp;<em>Man Don&rsquo;t Care</em>, his verbal
		physicality is pitiless, swearing to box anyone in the mouth with his
		BMW X6 key if they try to violate his lifework. By all means, this is
		all just hyped up trash talk, but his bars are sprayed with such brute
		professionalism that we can allow ourselves to suspend disbelief.
	</p>
	<p>
		JME&rsquo;s plucky berating of industry naysayers is&nbsp;<em>Integrity&gt;</em>&rsquo;s
		primary objective. During an awkward period in grime where some aim to
		monopolise on the false idea of a genre&rsquo;s resurgence, these 16
		songs play out&nbsp;as a razor-sharp recoil to such a pretence. And
		while the zeal is infinitely refreshing, there is enough familiarity
		to appeal to purists.
	</p>
	<p>
		Appearances from the scene&rsquo;s mainstays including D Double E,
		Jammer, Frisco and JME&rsquo;s brother, Skepta, act as a sign of
		camaraderie. The inclusion of longtime collaborator Deeco, along with
		eski-tinted mixes from Rude Kid, Teeza, Joker, Swifta Beater, and
		Preditah provide the homespun devilry for JME&rsquo;s playful
		mischief. Much like previous albums&nbsp;<em>Famous?</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Blam!</em>,
		the Lord of the Mics charm and schoolyard slander is ubiquitous:
		&ldquo;I came to this planet, a 8lbs caesarean/ Now, I&rsquo;m a
		badmanarean&rdquo;, &ldquo;Smiling ear to ear/ Revving hard like
		he&rsquo;s got a Dark Charizard.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		With Skepta&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>&nbsp;a swift album leak
		away,&nbsp;<em>Integrity&gt;</em>&nbsp;plays as the perfect precursor
		to a year that will see the Boy Better Know brand&rsquo;s longevity
		solidified. All of those years constructing flatpacks for reasonably
		priced snapbacks, hosting impromptu rap battles and denying a
		commercial stigma accusing the genre&rsquo;s innovators of encouraging
		gang violence, grime is now reaping the benefits it is duly owed. And
		JME&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Integrity&gt;</em>&nbsp;is the end product of
		grime&rsquo;s militant immortality.
