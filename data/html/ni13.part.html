		<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/">future</a>&nbsp;has
		become the antihero for men who believe emotional torture is essential
		to masculinity. After a splashy, very public relationship with the
		singer&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/">Ciara</a>,
		the two had a splashy, very public breakup that spilled from the
		courts and onto Twitter. In its wake, Future measured his pain into
		cups of codeine-spiked soda and poured it all over his music, most
		notably on 2015&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/">Dirty
				Sprite 2</a></em>. Dudes who lived vicariously through him dredged up all
		sorts of relationship trauma in order to wail alongside him, once more
		with feeling.
	</p>
	<p>
		After&nbsp;<em>DS2</em>&rsquo;s 4 a.m. drive through the desert,
		Future cartwheeling back into the heart-clutching love songs and
		sweet-street persona of his 2012 debut,&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/">Pluto</a></em>,
		might have been jarring. But nobody stays in beast mode forever,
		and&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22933-future/">FUTURE</a></em>,
		the companion piece to&nbsp;<em>HNDRXX</em>, showed a few cracks in
		his hardened facade. Heartbreaks heal, especially when you&rsquo;re a
		Romeo rapper with an R&amp;B bedside manner and an unending supply of
		Vicodin. Over a well-played hand of wistful, bright-eyed and
		reflective beats,&nbsp;<em>HNDRXX</em>&nbsp;strikes a near-perfect
		balance between a man still licking his wounds and a man emerging from
		a long, dark night.
	</p>
	<p>
		That&rsquo;s not to say there isn&rsquo;t a little bumpiness upon
		re-entry. For all of us who missed the old Future&mdash;that
		&ldquo;Turn on the Lights&rdquo; Future, that
		love-you-down-in-the-sheets and buy-you-a-new-Range-for-the-streets
		Future&mdash;<em>HNDRXX</em>&rsquo;s opener &ldquo;My
		Collection&rdquo; is a bit of a mind fuck. Over a wispy lullaby of a
		beat that sounds like more like an outro than an intro, Future peels
		off bills before asking, &ldquo;You wanna come to Pluto?&rdquo; Yes!
		Unfortunately, he lapses into light shaming of Ciara&rsquo;s sexual
		history before the cringe-worthy declaration, &ldquo;Even if I hit you
		once, you part of my collection.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		A trio of standard-issue songs follows, filled with flossy verses
		flush with cash, cars, designer namedrops and a couple funny lines
		(&ldquo;I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better
		clothes,&rdquo; he says in &ldquo;Lookin Exotic&rdquo;; &ldquo;Baby
		mama back drinking liquor/Now she tryin&rsquo; to fuck my life
		up&rdquo; in the DJ Mustard-produced &ldquo;Damage&rdquo;).&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/">The Weeknd</a>&rsquo;s
		sniveling on &ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18809-future-comin-out-strong-ft-the-weeknd/">Comin
			Out Strong</a>&rdquo; aside, these all blur together.
	</p>
	<p>But redemption comes on the ghostly &ldquo;Use Me.&rdquo; One of
		Future&rsquo;s gifts is imbuing his voice with such emotion that
		lyrics become putty in his hands.&nbsp;As shadows flit across the
		wall, the plaintive refrain of &ldquo;use me&rdquo; is made all the
		more gut-wrenching when he belts it. By the time an organ warbles onto
		the song, he&rsquo;s spent, his heart wrung dry. The shivery chorus
		begins to fade, and birds start chirping. It&rsquo;s chilly, but dawn
		has finally broken, and somebody's cooking Nayvadius breakfast this
		morning.</p>
	<p>
		&ldquo;Incredible&rdquo; and &ldquo;Testify&rdquo; are sun-warmed
		island beats that smell and shimmer like tanning oil-slicked
		shoulders. Future sounds like he&rsquo;s on vacation, loose as his
		limbs after that hot yoga class. &ldquo;I was havin&rsquo; trust
		issues/But I&rsquo;ve been havin&rsquo; way better luck since
		you,&rdquo; he starts off &ldquo;Incredible,&rdquo; relieved to baby
		talk again instead of bragging about another random bad bitch. Plenty
		of lines on&nbsp;<em>HNDRXX</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;melt hearts and make up
		for all games and the lies: &ldquo;I wanna hear your heart pump pound
		for pound &hellip;We conversin&rsquo; back and forth like we real
		partners/Spiritually we bonded through the turmoil.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough, he comes bearing a gentle pop duet
		with Rihanna, &ldquo;Selfish&rdquo; (featuring delicate production
		from Detail, Major Seven, and Mantra), and a seven-and-a-half minute
		apology, &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s still airing out grievances
		and self-medicating with a fistful of &lsquo;scripts, but the run from
		&ldquo;Use Me&rdquo; to &ldquo;I Thank U&rdquo; is inspired. The sun
		burns the edges of the clouds without entirely breaking through, which
		feels more honest, anyway.</p>
	<p>
		The old clich&eacute; is that artists produce better work when they're
		in pain, and it did seem like the deeper Future sank, the higher his
		star rose. Appreciating that without romanticizing or wallowing in his
		despair is key, as is allowing him freedom to create from a different
		emotional vantage point. As Charles Bukowski wrote in<a
			href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/let-it-enfold-you/"
			target="_blank">&nbsp;&ldquo;Let It Enfold You&rdquo;</a>:
		&ldquo;Either peace or happiness,/Let it enfold you/When I was a young
		man/I felt these things were/Dumb, unsophisticated.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		But Bukowski got that first part wrong. Peace and happiness do not
		simply &ldquo;enfold&rdquo; you. Sadness spreads like weeds, and
		channeling that into your music is a means of purging it so it
		won&rsquo;t choke you. It&rsquo;s joy that requires constant tending
		to grow. With&nbsp;<em>HNDRXX</em>, Future did just that, venturing
		back into the day for some fresh air with his woman who&rsquo;s frying
		bacon. The sand&rsquo;s like flour between their toes, and the music
		feels just fine.
