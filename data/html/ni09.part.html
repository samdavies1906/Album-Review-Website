		&ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18818-lil-uzi-vert-xo-tour-llif3/">XO
			Tour Llif3</a>&rdquo; is the sort of song artists spend years trying to
		write: pained and poised, tapping into a vein that had previously been
		found but never fully pierced. The &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care if
		you cry&rdquo; taunt that shouldn&rsquo;t be believed melting into
		&ldquo;All my friends are dead/Push me to the edge&rdquo; is a stretch
		of masterful songwriting, but withering in a way that few artists
		could mimic without tipping into self-parody. Its commercial
		benchmarks&mdash;No. 7 on Billboard, Platinum three times
		over&mdash;don&rsquo;t come close to capturing the depth with which
		people feel the song. It will probably define&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33832-lil-uzi-vert/">Lil Uzi
			Vert</a>for the rest of his career.
	</p>
	<p>
		Which is fine, because artists have been plagued by hits with just a
		fraction of the pathos &ldquo;XO Tour Llif3&rdquo; has. But Uzi has
		been an ascendant star for at least a year and a half: from promising
		rookie to SoundCloud darling to rap&rsquo;s A-list and beyond.
		He&rsquo;s proven himself a popular force with solo cuts like
		&ldquo;Money Longer&rdquo; and guest turns on Migos&rsquo; &ldquo;Bad
		and Boujee&rdquo; and Playboi Carti&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18975-playboi-carti-woke-up-like-this-ft-lil-uzi-vert/">Woke
			Up Like This</a>&rdquo;; dozens, hundreds of imitators across digital
		mixtape platforms cite him as a major creative influence, or at least
		a welcome distillation of whatever&rsquo;s happening in and around the
		Atlanta scene. And yet in some small way, Uzi&rsquo;s
		long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Luv Is Rage 2</em>&nbsp;is a referendum on
		whether he can live up to the standard &ldquo;XO Tour Llif3&rdquo;
		set. The goal isn&rsquo;t a streaming figure or a chart position, but
		a feeling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lofty as that is,&nbsp;<em>Luv Is Rage 2</em>&nbsp;comes very close to
		delivering. At its best, the album mines the psyches of exhausted and
		exhausting people, searching for the moment where enough drugs or
		heartbreak or iMessages or sleep deprivation can unlock a new part of
		the brain. It&rsquo;s the Philadelphia native&rsquo;s most musically
		developed work and features a bulk of his most interesting songs to
		date.
	</p>
	<p>Take &ldquo;The Way Life Goes,&rdquo; which is produced by Don
		Cannon and Ike Beatz. Uzi opens with a brief introduction to the other
		half of his failed relationship, punctuated with, &ldquo;I like that
		girl too much, I wish I never met her.&rdquo; From there, he launches
		into a full interpolation of the first verse from Oh Wonder&rsquo;s
		&ldquo;Landslide&rdquo;: &ldquo;I know it hurts sometimes, but
		you&rsquo;ll get over it/You&rsquo;ll find another life to
		live.&rdquo; Uzi&rsquo;s less interested in the granular drama of the
		breakup than in the fallout, the moment three or four days later when
		reality starts to set in.</p>
	<p>Over and over again, Uzi careens past the edge of convention or
		good social form. &ldquo;Pretty Mami&rdquo; is a desperate missive
		from a tour bus; the excellent song about his mother, &ldquo;Dark
		Queen,&rdquo; sounds less like an ode to a parent than a supernatural
		reckoning. The plunges into Uzi&rsquo;s psyche are mirrored by his
		delivery. He&rsquo;s chaotically animated, flitting between short
		staccato runs and heartfelt singing, punctuated by yelps and bug-eyed
		ad-libs. The perpetual churn of style and song structure can be a
		strength, or at the very least helps cover up songwriting that can
		tend toward formlessness. &ldquo;444+222,&rdquo; never finds its
		footing or has much to say, but at least keeps the listener on his or
		her toes long enough for Ike Beatz and Maaly Raw&rsquo;s beat to make
		its imprint.</p>
	<p>
		<em>Rage 2</em>&rsquo;s production is almost uniformly excellent,
		poppy and full of air, but with sinister undercurrents when Uzi
		summons something darker. (For the brighter side, see
		WondaGurl&rsquo;s &ldquo;How to Talk&rdquo; or Pharrell&rsquo;s
		particularly breezy &ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/lil-uzi-vert-neon-guts-ft-pharrell-williams/">Neon
			Guts</a>,&rdquo; where he also trades bars with Uzi.) If Lil Uzi Vert is
		innovating anything, it&rsquo;s a macro approach to the emotion and
		perspective in his songwriting. The technical aspects&mdash;his flows,
		vocal patterns, and even his vocal registers&mdash;owe plenty to his
		contemporaries and immediate predecessors from Atlanta and Chicago.
		Metro Boomin and Pierre Bourne&rsquo;s propulsive &ldquo;X,&rdquo; for
		example, could be lifted from one of the many batches of Young Thug
		leaks, down to its operative line: &ldquo;Yeah, my life&rsquo;s a
		mess/But I&rsquo;m also blessed.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		What makes Uzi&rsquo;s music his own is that instead of a one-off
		appraisal, he combs through his heart and Gmail to figure out just how
		the blessings and messiness interact.&nbsp;<em>Luv Is Rage 2</em>&nbsp;is
		ultimately a record about keeping it together when your wits and
		resolve have been tested and depleted. (The Weeknd-assisted radio play
		&ldquo;UnFazed&rdquo; falls flat precisely because Abel&rsquo;s
		practiced stoicism doesn&rsquo;t gel with Uzi&rsquo;s risk-it-all
		performance). Whether he&rsquo;s full of joy or howling into the void,
		he pushes his songs to their edge, which helps to deliver on the
		promise shown in his earlier work. We knew Lil Uzi Vert would become
		one of rap&rsquo;s biggest stars, but&nbsp;<em>Rage 2</em>suggests
		that he may spend his time on top experimenting rather than retreating
		to a comfort zone.
