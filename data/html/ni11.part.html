		ife is one funny motherfucker, it&rsquo;s true.
		&ldquo;DUCKWORTH.,&rdquo; the last song on&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/">Kendrick
			Lamar</a>'s fourth studio album&nbsp;<em>DAMN.,</em>&nbsp;tells a winding
		story about Anthony from Compton and Ducky from Chicago, whose paths
		cross first over KFC biscuits, and again, 20 years later, when
		Ducky&rsquo;s son records a song about the encounter for
		Anthony&rsquo;s record label. It&rsquo;s a precious origin story, the
		stuff of rock docs and hood DVDs, and it&rsquo;s delivered with such
		precision, vivid detail, and masterful pacing that it can&rsquo;t
		possibly be true. But it&rsquo;s a tale too strange to be fiction, and
		too powerful not to believe in&mdash;just like its author. Kendrick
		Lamar has proven he&rsquo;s a master storyteller, but he&rsquo;s been
		saving his best plot twist this whole time, waiting until he was
		ready, or able, to pull it off.
	</p>
	<p>
		Storytelling&nbsp;has been Lamar&rsquo;s greatest skill and most
		primary mission, to put into (lots of) words what it's like to grow up
		as he did&mdash;to articulate, in human terms, the intimate specifics
		of daily self-defense from your surroundings. Somehow, he&rsquo;s
		gotten better. The raps on his fourth studio album&nbsp;<em>DAMN.</em>&nbsp;jab
		mercilessly like a sewing machine. His boyish nasal instrument is
		distinct and inimitable as it slithers up and down in pitch on
		&ldquo;PRIDE.&rdquo; Even when Lamar sounds like&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/">Eminem</a>,
		or&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/">Drake</a>,
		or&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/">OutKast</a>,
		he sounds like himself, and he arguably outpaces them all as a writer.
		On&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18993-kendrick-lamar-fear/">&ldquo;FEAR.,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;he
		relays daily threats from his mom (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat your ass,
		keep talking back/I&rsquo;ll beat your ass, who bought you that? You
		stole it&rdquo;) and from his neighbors (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably
		die because I ain&rsquo;t know Demarcus was snitching/I&rsquo;ll
		probably die at these house parties fucking with bitches&rdquo;) over
		low-slung blues stirred by&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/">The
			Alchemist</a>. Lamar&rsquo;s recitation is so effortless you wonder where
		he breathes, or if he does at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kendrick is a relic of the mid-aughts rap blog era, where bedroom
		WordPress pages would post .zips of albums by amateurs. After years of
		such releases, Kendrick dropped a self-titled EP in 2009 that featured
		Big Pooh from Little Brother and elicited such Nah Right comments as
		&ldquo;I like the beats on this&rdquo; and &ldquo;who da fuk?&rdquo;
		Accolades swelled with each project; by 2011, he was considering
		signing with&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/">Dr.
			Dre</a>; by 2013, he was playing &ldquo;SNL&rdquo; and touring with&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>.
		He came of age with his fans, and by 2015&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20390-to-pimp-a-butterfly/">To
				Pimp a Butterfly</a></em>, he put to music their chest-clenched frustrations.
		Ever the curtain-puller, he released an album of&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21705-untitled-unmastered/">untitled
			and unmastered drafts</a>&nbsp;and grew his hair out. His short absence,
		even after lending Taylor Swift a verse, has been made to feel longer
		by his media shyness and a surging tide of new rappers shuttled out
		daily.
	</p>
	<p>Throughout it all, he&rsquo;s avoided the boxed-in fates of
		predecessors like Nas and peers like J. Cole through an electric
		originality and curiosity. He mastered rap not for mastery&rsquo;s
		sake, but to use it as a form, undeterred by slow-eared fans
		who&rsquo;ll only highlight his &ldquo;simplest lines.&rdquo; His best
		new trick is repetition; it offsets his density and drills his ideas,
		as enthralling as a Sunday sermon or pre-fight chirp session. There
		have been few threats committed to record as sincere as, &ldquo;Let
		somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman/Touch my
		daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my
		brother&rdquo;&mdash;you tick down the list along with him, slot in
		your&nbsp;own lifelong bonds with loved ones. Such internal processing
		plays out through the album&rsquo;s Greek chorus, via the singer
		Bēkon, who speaks in riddles of balance throughout: &ldquo;Is it
		wickedness, is it weakness;&rdquo; &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s gonna get you
		killed, but pride&rsquo;s gonna be the death of you;&rdquo; &ldquo;It
		was always me versus the world/Until I found it&rsquo;s me versus
		me.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>
		<em>DAMN.</em>&nbsp;is best in these philosophical spaces. It lags
		slightly around the center, where the concept loosens:
		&ldquo;LOYALTY.,&rdquo; with Rihanna, has all the makings of a radio
		mainstay this summer, and is as low-stakes as the platform demands;
		it&rsquo;s always fun to hear Rih rap, and her presence is its most
		interesting aspect. &ldquo;LUST.&rdquo; would sound better if it
		weren&rsquo;t next to an ear-worm as tender as &ldquo;LOVE.,&rdquo;
		which slow-dances between&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/72851-kendrick-lamars-damn-collaborator-zacari-talks-new-song-love-and-more/">Zacari</a>&nbsp;falsettos
		and Lamar&rsquo;s sheepish read of the girl who fills him up. Between
		the two tracks, it&rsquo;s easy to tell which force is tugging at him
		harder.
	</p>
	<p>
		The record&rsquo;s few lulls succumb to what surrounds them. The
		springboard bounce of &ldquo;HUMBLE.,&rdquo; the war chant of&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18994-kendrick-lamar-dna/">&ldquo;DNA.,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;and
		hot steel of &ldquo;XXX.&rdquo; show Kendrick in his element, fast and
		lucid, like Eazy-E with college credits and&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/">Mike
			WiLL</a>&nbsp;beats. The production is taut and clean, but schizophrenic,
		often splicing two or three loops into a track and swaying between
		tempos, closer in kin to&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/">good
				kid, m.A.A.d city</a></em>&rsquo;s siren-synths than&nbsp;<em>Butterfly&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;brass
		solos. If he was &ldquo;black as the moon&rdquo; on his last album,
		he&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Israelite&rdquo; here, refusing to identify
		himself by the shade of his skin but fluent in the contents of his
		D.N.A.&nbsp;<em>Butterfly</em>&nbsp;floated along to soften its
		scathing stance&mdash;&ldquo;We hate po-po&rdquo; sounds better over a
		smooth saxophone&mdash;but with so many &ldquo;wack artists&rdquo; in
		play, what&rsquo;s the reward for upliftment? Kendrick is so alone at
		his altitude that when he acknowledges Fox News, let alone Donald
		Trump, it feels like a favor to them both.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still, the album exists for &ldquo;DUCKWORTH.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the
		final piece of the TDE puzzle, a homegrown label of Compton natives
		that happened to deliver the best rapper of his generation. If
		we&rsquo;re to believe the song&rsquo;s last gunshot&mdash;and its
		seamless loop back to track one&mdash;much of&nbsp;<em>DAMN.</em>&nbsp;is
		written from the perspective of a Kendrick Lamar who grew up without a
		father to guide him away from the sinful temptations outside his home.
		He bobs in and out of this perspective, but the repeated pledges to
		loyalty and martyrdom evoke the life and mind of a young gang member
		who carries his neighborhood flag because no one&rsquo;s proved to him
		that he shouldn&rsquo;t. These choices, Lamar suggests, aren&rsquo;t
		pre-determined or innate, but in constant dialogue with and in
		reaction to their surrounding circumstances. They aren&rsquo;t above
		or beneath anyone who can hear his voice. Success and failure choose
		their subjects at their whim; we&rsquo;re as grateful as Kendrick for
		his fate.
