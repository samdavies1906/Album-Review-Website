<p>Album: Culture 2</p>
<p>Artist:&nbsp;Migos</p>
<p>Genre:&nbsp;Trap music</p>
<p>Release Date:&nbsp;26 January 2018</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This follow-up to 2017&rsquo;s rapturously received &lsquo;Culture&rsquo; 
sees them cement their reputation for musical innovation, sly humour and louche delivery as they develop 
the short, triplet rhymes that have become their signature sound. The album is 24 tracks long, indicating 
the seemingly endless supplies of inspiration that the group appear to have harnessed since 2015&rsquo;s&nbsp;
<em>Yung Rich Nation</em>&nbsp;stamped their passports as superstars-in-waiting. The basic template is often
 rooted in the Atlanta sound &ndash; stuttering snares, austere production and percussive vocal onomatopoeia 
 &ndash; which enables them to deviate intro experimentation while remaining accessible. Not only that, but the 
 guestlist is positively stuffed with stars: Drake, 2 Chainz, Big Sean, Nicki Minaj and Gucci Mane himself all 
 lend a hand.<br /><br /></p>

<p>&lsquo;BBO &rsquo; combines brass arrangements and an understated gospel vocal line, 
while the pensive &lsquo;Emoji a Chain&rsquo; bows out with a sleepy, languid, Eastern-influenced guitar 
solo. These moments are a reminder of the quiet amounts of weird that Migos have managed to smuggle into 
the mainstream. Their commercial calling card, 2013&rsquo;s &lsquo;Versace Versace&rsquo;, was dismissed 
by as some as a trivial, superficial ode to materialism, but on &lsquo;Culture II&rsquo; they prove &ndash;
 in typically aloof fashion &ndash; that their influences are as varied as they are sophisticated. There&rsquo;
 s a Kanye West collaboration in the vaults, too, waiting for release, so there&rsquo;s more than enough gas in 
 the tank to ensure that the Migos machine continues to churn out the hits.</p>
	
	<figure>The standout is perhaps &lsquo;Stir Fry&rsquo;, a jubilant boom-bap banger that&rsquo;s adorned with hissing 
	hi-hat, marching synth, shrill whistle sound effects and the group&rsquo;s unmistakably swift, undulating flow. Offset&rsquo;s 
	fianc&eacute; Cardi B delivers perhaps the album&rsquo;s single most impressive bar, flouncing into &lsquo;MotorSport&rsquo; 
	to joke that&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I turn Offset on&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp;Well, Migos are firing on all cylinders here, their new record
	 a lush, chaotic patchwork that pops with primary colours. The fab three have done it again.</figure>
