		o the casual listener, grime might seem like a once-dormant genre in
		the midst of a revival. But truth be told, the hybrid of hip-hop and
		UK garage never went anywhere&mdash;the only thing that changed was
		the genre&rsquo;s visibility. Ever since grime&rsquo;s emergence on
		British pirate radio at the turn of the millennium, the UK mainstream
		(not to mention American listeners) has tended to pay attention to the
		genre only when it produces a charismatic star. Wiley knows this
		better than most. He was a chief architect of grime&rsquo;s early
		sound (his tracks were among the first&nbsp;to be labeled
		&ldquo;grime&rdquo;), assembled the seminal&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/7487-roll-deep/">Roll Deep</a>&nbsp;crew,
		helped his prot&eacute;g&eacute;&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/1096-dizzee-rascal/">Dizzee
			Rascal</a>&nbsp;become grime&rsquo;s first breakout artist and later,
		pushed the genre even deeper into the mainstream with a string of
		successful club-pop singles. He&rsquo;s somehow managed to weather the
		interest of a fickle public for two full decades, though he has plenty
		of scars to show for it. In response to allegations of selling out,
		he&rsquo;s spent a good deal of his career apologizing for and
		actively disowning any&nbsp;<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxjdg_D5YQY" target="_blank">attempts
			he&rsquo;s made to court a wider audience</a>, though his frequent
		course-corrections have sometimes felt more like self-sabotage.
		He&rsquo;s a survivor, if not a particularly triumphant one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given this history, you&rsquo;d think Wiley would be frustrated to
		find that the latest wave of grime artists have arrived
		at&nbsp;success far more easily and on their own terms: for
		today&rsquo;s emcees, staying true to grime&rsquo;s sound and topping
		the charts are hardly mutually exclusive. Instead, Wiley seems
		reinvigorated by his peers' achievements, especially
		those&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5921-skepta/">Skepta</a>, the
		latest of his mentees to follow in Dizzee&rsquo;s footsteps, Mercury
		Prize and all. Supposedly his parting gift to the culture he helped
		birth,&nbsp;<em>Godfather</em>&nbsp;finds Wiley attempting to pull off
		the same trick that Skepta did with&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21858-konnichiwa/">Konnichiwa</a></em>:
		a lifer goes back to his roots and channels the energy of a hungry
		upstart. It&rsquo;s a tall order for a rapper pushing 40 but&nbsp;<em>Godfather</em>&nbsp;largely
		delivers, feeling at once like a return to form for Wiley and a
		celebration of grime&rsquo;s foundational sound.
	</p>
	<p>
		Part of the album&rsquo;s success stems from its single-minded focus.
		Unlike many of Wiley's albums,&nbsp;<em>Godfather</em>&nbsp;tends to
		cut to the chase, that being manic, double-time rapping over chirpy
		140 bpm beats. Production has always been Wiley&rsquo;s primary
		strength but on&nbsp;<em>Godfather</em>, he mostly absolves himself of
		those duties, turning over the boards to young upstarts like Preditah
		and Swifta Beater, as well as seasoned vets like&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/6041-rude-kid/">Rude Kid</a>.
		Still, each of these collaborators works in service of the overarching
		mission: songs that update Wiley&rsquo;s blocky &ldquo;eskibeat&rdquo;
		sound using modern production techniques.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wiley has never been a&nbsp;<em>great</em>&nbsp;rapper per se, but on
		every song here he shows up with a surplus of energy, confidence and
		charisma. On the frantic &ldquo;Bait Face,&rdquo; he goes bar-for-bar
		with his old crewmate Scratchy without breaking a sweat. He sounds
		right at home on the torch-passing posse cut &ldquo;Name Brand,&rdquo;
		which brings together Roll Deep member J2K with Jme and Frisco from
		Boy Better Know. On tracks like &ldquo;Birds N Bars&rdquo; and
		&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Go Wrong,&rdquo; he&nbsp;borrows Skepta&rsquo;s
		breathless flow but cuts it with a halting, staccato delivery. There
		are, of course, a few corny one-liners scattered throughout the record
		(&ldquo;I stand out like one break light,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fresh out the
		oven like a Sunday roast,&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re plain, I&rsquo;m
		the loaded nachos&rdquo;) and even an entire song dedicated to his
		MacBook Pro (&ldquo;Laptop&rdquo;). However, at this point in
		Wiley&rsquo;s career, it&rsquo;s hard for this stuff to read as
		anything but endearingly goofy, more like dad jokes than genuine
		missteps.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ultimately,&nbsp;<em>Godfather</em>&nbsp;is a thoroughly enjoyable
		record, one that manages to leverage grime&rsquo;s elemental sounds in
		a way that feels vital and forward-looking. Sure, its peaks might not
		be quite as high as those of&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>, the record that
		it&rsquo;s bound to be measured against (Skepta&rsquo;s mastery of the
		massive, shout-along hook continues to give him an edge). But for
		anyone who&rsquo;s ever rooted for Wiley, it&rsquo;s a deeply
		satisfying listen. After all, until recently, Wiley disowned not just
		the &ldquo;godfather of grime&rdquo; nickname but the term
		&ldquo;grime&rdquo; altogether. And here he is, unapologetically
		owning his influence, toasting to his peers&rsquo; successes and
		claiming his rightful place as grime&rsquo;s elder statesman. Who
		knows if&nbsp;<em>Godfather</em>&nbsp;is actually Wiley&rsquo;s final
		solo album&mdash;we&rsquo;ve certainly&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10346-playtime-is-over/">heard
			that one from him before</a>. But if it is, he can step away knowing that
		his legacy has been secured.
