			target="_blank">Drake</a>&nbsp;calls his superb new&nbsp;<em>More
			Life</em>&nbsp;a "playlist," not an album or even a mixtape, yet that
		might be why it sounds so expressive, so emotional, so
		quintessentially Drakean. When you get right down to it, Aubrey
		Graham&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a playlist &ndash; a true pop visionary
		who's always a fan at heart, an omnivore with a raging appetite for
		his next favorite sound.&nbsp;<em>More Life</em>is his finest longform
		collection in years, cheerfully indulgent at 22 tracks and 82 minutes,
		a masterful tour of all the grooves in his head, from U.K. grime ("No
		Long Talk") to Caribbean dancehall ("Blem") to South African house
		("Get It Together") to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire ("Glow"). Yet the more
		expansive he gets, the more himself he sounds &ndash; and the further
		he roams around the globe, the deeper he taps into the heart of
		Drakeness.
	</p>
	<p>
		But even though&nbsp;<em>More Life</em>&nbsp;is Drake at his most
		receptive to the outside world, it also feels far more personal than
		his lackluster official 2016 album,&nbsp;<em>Views</em>, even though
		that was virtually all Drake all the time. And it's more playful than
		brand-buffing rap mixtapes like&nbsp;<em>If You're Reading This
			It's Too Late</em>&nbsp;or his Future collabo&nbsp;<em>What a Time to
			Be Alive</em>. He generously includes solo tracks for artists like Sampha
		and Skepta, providing killer showcases for London newcomers like Giggs
		and Jorja Smith as well as Atlanta gods like 2 Chainz and Young Thug,
		who shines in totally different modes in "Sacrifice" and "Ice Melts."
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>More Life</em>&nbsp;might flaunt his internationalist outlook,
		building on the success of "One Dance" last summer. But needless to
		say, wherever he goes, he's still stuck being Drake, which means he's
		still fixated on why that girl won't text him back. (Wait &ndash;
		she's getting&nbsp;<em>married</em>? And she didn't even send him
		an&nbsp;<em>invitation</em>?) No matter how much he vents about his
		haters, they're not really what fires him up. That would be girls,
		obviously &ndash; including Jennifer Lopez. ("I drunk text J. Lo/Old
		number, so it bounce back" &ndash; damn, it just doesn't get Draker
		than that.) "Teenage Fever" is a near-perfect electro-swoon groove,
		where Drake sings the chorus of Lopez's first Nineties single, "If You
		Had My Love," as if he's feeling every word. The fact that Drake can
		find so much emotional resonance in one of the Nineties' most abysmal
		hits is just another tribute to his brilliance.
	</p>
	<p>"Passionfruit" is the pick of the litter, a Nana Rogues
		production with a vintage disco throb as Drake croons about a special
		lady who's "passionate from miles away/Passive with the things you
		say." He gallantly tells her, "You got issues that I won't mention for
		now." (Of course he won't &ndash; he'd have to stop brooding about his
		own.) "Glow" is a duet with Kanye West (a friendly gesture, if not
		quite a keeper of a song); "Since Way Back" brings in PartyNextDoor
		for an R&amp;B shout out to both R. Kelly and Jacques Derrida
		("everything these days is textual"). "Portland" features Travis Scott
		and Migos' Quavo at top strength.</p>
	<p>
		One of the most surprisingly effective guests: Drake's mom, who leaves
		a voicemail at the end of "Can't Have Everything," after Drake rattles
		off a long list of ways the world has pissed him of, giving him a bad
		case of "all that Drake hysteria." After Drake airs his grievances
		against Meek Mill and others &ndash; "tried to serve me a cheesesteak,
		gave them back a clean plate" &ndash; his mom steps to the mike and
		clears her throat, warning, "You know, hon, I'm a bit concerned about
		this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice this days." The
		woman has a point, and Drake knows it, but that maternal own is more
		than just a great punch line &ndash; it's a masterful flourish from an
		artist who always sounds most inspired when he remembers to look
		beyond his own head. On&nbsp;<em>More Life</em>, he's wearing less and
		going out more &ndash; and it does his music a world of good.&nbsp;
