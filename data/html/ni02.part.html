	<p>
		&ldquo;White Iverson&rdquo; is not a foundational brick; it is a
		sandcastle on a windy day with a high tide. No one who appreciated the
		breezy distraction of a radio song in 2015 wanted to hear nearly 70
		minutes of&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33674-post-malone/">Post
			Malone</a>&nbsp;a year later. There are new one-hit wonders to enjoy;
		there are pop icons making important works; there&rsquo;s probably a
		book somewhere worth reading.
	</p>
	<p>
		The song was charming, though: Through the haze of its production and
		Post Malone&rsquo;s slurred delivery was a certain nostalgic desire
		and childlike wonder. Somehow, he hopped on a tour with&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33315-justin-bieber/">Justin
			Bieber</a>, and Universal subsidiary Republic Records believed that&nbsp;<em>Stoney</em>,
		a 68-minute long dirge, was the correct use of his talents. Even if
		you liked &ldquo;White Iverson,&rdquo; was there anyone who thought to
		themselves,&nbsp;<em>I want to hear this guy&rsquo;s story!
			What&rsquo;s he all about? We need to know more!?</em>&nbsp;For all
		of&nbsp;<em>Stoney</em>&rsquo;s faults, its most damning one poisons
		the record at the source: This thing is completely soulless.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s not for a lack of trying, however&mdash;Post Malone (real
		name: Austin Post) is presenting his most authentic self here, talking
		openly about relationships and taking too many drugs and drinking a
		little too much, amidst numerous &ldquo;we made it&rdquo; anthems. But
		he&rsquo;s simply not a compelling artist; he doesn&rsquo;t say
		anything new about these struggles, doesn&rsquo;t frame them in a
		particularly memorable way, and has nothing to say now that he&rsquo;s
		wrestled with his fame. What pushes&nbsp;<em>Stoney</em>&nbsp;past
		being merely forgettable and into a kind of cynical, punishing listen
		is the access to a bunch of producers and songwriters that came
		together behind the 21 year old to ensure a product so highly
		polished, and so clearly connect-the-dots, it robs him of any trace of
		charm. The album ends up doubling as a tacit acknowledgment that, hey,
		maybe this guy is just not that interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		If it&rsquo;s lowlights you want,&nbsp;<em>Stoney</em>&rsquo;s got
		them: &ldquo;I Fall Apart&rdquo; brutally crashes the party, appearing
		right after &ldquo;White Iverson.&rdquo; The song is full of acoustic
		guitars, and features Post&rsquo;s most obnoxious crutch: that weird
		little vibrato thing he does, a vain attempt to convey emotion.
		&ldquo;I Fall Apart,&rdquo; a self-lacerating breakup anthem,
		recalls&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/25025-staind/">Staind</a>,
		working that same woe-is-me white boy pain with an unpleasant voice
		slathered all over it. &ldquo;Go Flex&rdquo; boasts a foot-stomp
		chorus and enough echo to sound exactly like the Lumineers or any
		other faceless &ldquo;whoa-oh-oh&rdquo; band; it&rsquo;s as unholy as
		it sounds on paper.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Stoney</em>&nbsp;indulges in a few huge, expertly written,
		admittedly catchy hooks, but since Post doesn&rsquo;t have a strong
		voice and is usually not saying much more than cliches, many of these
		faux-triumphant songs sound tailor-made for headphone commercials.
		See: &ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; with a &ldquo;let me collect this
		check&rdquo; Quavo appearance, or &ldquo;Too Young,&rdquo; a song
		that&rsquo;s probably about a year old, and already in line to appear
		on the soundtrack for the next movie about a white boxer.
	</p>
	<p>
		To its credit,&nbsp;<em>Stoney</em>&nbsp;lets its best run of songs
		loose near the beginning of the album, after turgid opener
		&ldquo;Broken Whiskey Glass.&rdquo; &ldquo;Big Lie&rdquo; has a nice,
		booming&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/">DJ
			Mustard</a>&nbsp;beat, sounding like something that could&rsquo;ve been
		on&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21540-anti/">ANTI</a></em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22020-sremmlife-2/">SremmLife
				2</a></em>, and one of the record&rsquo;s strongest hooks, mostly because it
		plays into the same kind of sleepy-eyed charm of &ldquo;White
		Iverson.&rdquo; The baroque beats on songs like &ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18519-post-malone-justin-bieber-deja-vu/">D&eacute;j&agrave;
			Vu</a>,&rdquo; with&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33315-justin-bieber/">Justin
			Bieber</a>, and the&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/">Pharrell</a>-assisted
		&ldquo;Up There,&rdquo; are begging for someone with a little more
		humor to show up, maybe&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/">Young Thug</a>&nbsp;or
		any of the under-21 Atlanta guys. Still, Post Malone finds those
		grooves nicely, and they are the least burdensome songs on the record.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a perhaps wishfully optimistic hope that&nbsp;<em>Stoney</em>&nbsp;could
		mark the end of a specific kind of rap album: the spiffy cash-in after
		the viral hit or mixtape run. Post feels like the flimsiest artist yet
		to get this treatment, and he got such an extravagant treatment at
		that. With a recent era of mixtape rappers on the decline, along with
		the steady hemorrhaging of album sales and bigger names taking bigger
		risks, it seems as if this type of hollow release&nbsp;could soon
		become as anachronistic as an $18 CD is today.
