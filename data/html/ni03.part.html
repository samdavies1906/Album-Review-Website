		When&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nme.com/artists/the-weeknd">The
			Weeknd</a>&nbsp;was planning to shear off his dreadlock beehive a couple
		of months ago, the unanimous phrase of discouragement from those
		around him &ndash; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your whole thing&rdquo; &ndash;
		only spurred him on. Because really, Ab&eacute;l Tesfaye&rsquo;s
		&ldquo;whole thing&rdquo; is turning his druggy R&amp;B to gold. After
		a trio of lauded 2011 mixtapes and a tepid 2013 debut, the mysterious
		Toronto sadboy broke through in a big way with &lsquo;Beauty Behind
		The Madness&rsquo;, Spotify&rsquo;s most-streamed album of 2015. Now,
		just over a year later, this bloated double album comes accompanied by
		the weight of expectation &ndash; will it take the 26-year-old up yet
		another level?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, there&rsquo;s no mega-smash-in-waiting like &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t
		Feel My Face&rsquo; (surely now the cokehead&rsquo;s love song of
		choice) but Tesfaye&rsquo;s still capable of&nbsp;brilliant bluntness
		about intoxication and sex &ndash; usually&nbsp;at the same time. On
		&lsquo;Rockin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s on Adderall and spurning a&nbsp;clingy
		girl. On &lsquo;Ordinary Life&rsquo; he gets wistful midway through a
		45mph blow-job: &ldquo;I can feel her teeth when I drive on a
		bump&hellip;she don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done&rdquo;. On Lana
		Del Rey co-write &lsquo;Party Monster&rsquo;, the hook is a little
		hackneyed (&ldquo;Woke up by a girl, I don&rsquo;t even know her
		name&rdquo;) but it still does its earworming job&nbsp;<span
			class="skimlinks-unlinked">perfectly.The</span>&nbsp;best thing on
		here is the juddering &lsquo;Secrets&rsquo; &ndash;&nbsp;where a
		jealous Tesfaye lowers his voice to reprimand a lying girlfriend
		&ndash; but more focus will inevitably go to the collaborations. Del
		Rey herself pipes up&nbsp;on &lsquo;Stargirl Interlude&rsquo;, a
		deceptively delicate&nbsp;ditty set in a kitchen. On
		&lsquo;Sidewalks&rsquo; Kendrick Lamar delivers a typically killer
		verse over what sounds like one of Jonny Greenwood&rsquo;s Radiohead
		guitar lines. Then there are the two Daft Punk features that bookend
		the album: opener &lsquo;Starboy&rsquo; is&nbsp;a moody
		acknowledgement of his celebrity, while closer &lsquo;I Feel It
		Coming&rsquo; is a beauty, on which Tesfaye&rsquo;s trembling vocal
		unmistakeably echoes Michael Jackson&rsquo;s. Unfortunately, Daft Punk
		mar their subtle, syncopated production&nbsp;with a rude vocoder
		intrusion.
	</p>
	<p>
		If there&rsquo;s a problem here, it&rsquo;s the obvious 2016 one:
		length. Streaming charts favour albums with more songs, like
		Drake&rsquo;s 80-minute &lsquo;Views&rsquo;. At 18 tracks
		&nbsp;and&nbsp;68 minutes, it&rsquo;s impossible not to see
		&lsquo;Starboy&rsquo; aiming for those algorithms.<br />Deep into the
		album it becomes a slog, with too much banal, forgettable fluff like
		&lsquo;Attention&rsquo;, &lsquo;Nothing Without You&rsquo; and
		&lsquo;Die For You&rsquo; (this honestly goes, &ldquo;I would die for
		you / I would lie for you&rdquo;). Cutting his hair was no risk
		&ndash; the real Starboy move would have been cutting&nbsp;the crap.
