		ablo Picasso and Kanye West share many qualities&mdash;impatience with
		formal schooling, insatiable and complicated&nbsp;<a
			href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/483355"
			target="_blank">sexual appetites</a>, a vampiric fascination with
		beautiful&nbsp;<a
			href="http://www.sapergalleries.com/PicassoWomen.html"
			target="_blank">women as muses</a>&mdash;but Pablo Picasso was&nbsp;<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc2iLAubras" target="_blank">never
			called an asshole</a>. Kanye, specifically,&nbsp;<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek" target="_blank">toasted
			them</a>.&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>'s namesake is a provocation, a
		mystery, a sly acknowledgement of multitudes: Drug lord Pablo Escobar
		is a permanent fixture of rap culture, but the mystery of "<a
			href="http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-life-of-pablo-which-famous-pablo-has-kanye-west-named-his-new-album-after"
			target="_blank">which one?</a>" set Twitter theorists down
		fascinating rabbit holes, drawing up convincing stand-ins for Kanye's
		Blue Period (<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/">808s
				&amp; Heartbreak</a></em>), his Rose Period (<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/">My
				Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></em>), and his Crystal Period (<em><a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/">Yeezus</a></em>).
		If Kanye is comparable to Picasso,&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;is
		the moment, after a turbulent life leaving many artistic revolutions
		and mistreated women in his wake, that the artist finally settles
		down. In this formulation, Kim Kardashian is Jacqueline Roque,
		Picasso's final muse and the woman to whom he remained faithful (she
		even kinda&nbsp;<a
			href="http://viola.bz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/portraits-by-Picasso-of-Jacqueline-Roque.jpg"
			target="_blank">looks like a Kardashian</a>), and the record is the
		sound of a celebrated megalomaniac settling for his place in history.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>The Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;is, accordingly, the first Kanye West
		album that's just an album: No major statements, no reinventions, no
		zeitgeist wheelie-popping. It's probably his first full-length that
		won't activate a new sleeper cell of 17-year-old would-be rappers and
		artists. He's changed the genre's DNA with every album, to the point
		where each has inspired a generation of direct offspring, and now
		everywhere he looks, he sees mirrors. "See, I invented Kanye, it
		wasn't any Kanyes, and now I look and look around and there's so many
		Kanyes," he raps wryly on "I Love Kanye." The message seems clear:
		He's through creating new Kanyes, at least for now. He's content to
		just stand among them, both those of his own creation and&nbsp;<a

	</p>
	<p>
		Kanye's second child Saint was born in early December, and there's
		something distinctly preoccupied about this whole project&mdash;it
		feels wry, hurried, mostly good-natured, and somewhat sloppy. Like a
		lot of new parents, Kanye feels laser-focused on big stuff&mdash;love,
		serenity, forgiveness, karma&mdash;and a little frazzled on the
		details. "Ultralight Beam" opens with the sound of a&nbsp;<a
			href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8jmM8lixW/?taken-by=sheisnatalie"
			target="_blank">4-year-old preaching gospel</a>, some organ, and a
		church choir: "This is a God dream," goes the refrain. But everything
		about the album's presentation&mdash;the churning tracklist, the
		broken promises to premiere it here or there, the scribbled guest
		list&mdash;feels like Kanye ran across town to deliver a half-wrapped
		gift to a group birthday party to which he was 10 minutes late.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, he's bringing a Kanye album, and Kanye albums make pretty
		goddamn good gifts. His devotion to the craft of album-making remains
		his greatest talent. Albums are his legacy, what he knows, deep down,
		will endure after the circus of attention he maintains around him
		subsides. His ability to package hundreds of stray threads into a
		whole that feels not just thrilling, but *inevitable&mdash;*at this,
		he is better than everyone, and he throws all of his best tricks
		into&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;to remind us. He picks the
		right guests and gives them idealized settings, making people you
		don't care about sound fantastic and people you&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;care
		about sound immortal. Chance the Rapper, a spiritual heir to
		backpack-and-a-Benz Kanye if there ever was one, is given the
		spotlight on the opener "Ultralight Beam," and uses his dazed, happy
		verse to quote both "Otis" and the bonus track to<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8768-late-registration/">&nbsp;<em>Late
				Registration</em></a>. His joy is palpable, and it's clear he has waited his
		entire adult life to be featured on a Kanye album. On the other hand,
		"Fade" pits Future knockoff Post Malone, of all people, against a
		sample of Chicago house legend Larry Heard's "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJv6qBOZbw" target="_blank">Mystery
			of Love</a>" and a flip of Motown blues rock band Rare Earth's "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F28X8--2dFU" target="_blank">I
			Know I'm Losing You</a>" and rigs the mix so that Malone, somehow, sounds
		more important than both of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		This moment is also a reminder of Kanye's audacious touch with huge,
		immediately recognizable pieces of musical history&mdash;his best work
		as a producer has always drawn from iconic songs so venerated most
		sane people wouldn't dare touch them, from "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY" target="_blank">Gold
			Digger</a>" to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0QcxWPB59o"
			target="_blank">Blood on the Leaves</a>" and beyond. He doesn't
		just&nbsp;<em>sample</em>&nbsp;these songs, he climbs in and joyrides
		them like the Maybach in the "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU" target="_blank">Otis</a>"
		video. On "Famous," he does it twice, first by matching up Nina
		Simone's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4xde537g1A"
			target="_blank">Do What You Gotta Do</a>" with Rihanna, who sings the
		song's hook before Nina does, and then with Sister Nancy's "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcaPu9JPenU" target="_blank">Bam
			Bam</a>," which gets flipped so it sits atop a chorale-like chord
		progression. It sounds like a dancehall remix of Pachelbel's Canon,
		and it's the most joyful two minutes of music on the album.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Waves," a song that made the tracklist at the last second at Chance
		the Rapper's&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/63529-kanye-west-saturday-night-live-performance-features-chance-the-rapper-young-thug-the-dream-kelly-price-kirk-franklin-and-more/">insistence</a>,
		has a similar energy. You can hear why Chance, specifically, might've
		wanted it back: It is a throwback to the&nbsp;<a
			href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Rainbow_Road_(N64)" target="_blank">Rainbow
			Road</a>&nbsp;maximalism of "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6mVccIqq2I" target="_blank">We
			Major</a>," and it is so warmly redemptive it even makes Chris Brown, who
		sings the hook, sound momentarily benevolent. "Waves" is hardly the
		only last-second change made: The Kendrick Lamar collaboration "No
		More Parties In L.A." is back on here, as is an inexplicable
		minute-long voicemail from imprisoned rapper Max B, granting Kanye
		permission to use his popular slang term "<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/63189-kanye-west-viciously-attacks-wiz-khalifa-in-incredible-twitter-rant/">wavy</a>."
		Such last-second fidgets seem to say something about&nbsp;<em>The
			Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;itself. After years of agonizing over how to
		follow up the conceptually triumphant&nbsp;<em>808s &amp;
			Heartbreak</em>,&nbsp;<em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>,
		and&nbsp;<em>Yeezus</em>, he seems to have settled upon eternal flux
		as a resting place, and the album plays like Kanye might still be
		remixing it furiously in your headphones while you listen.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Father Stretch My Hands" tosses a sample from Southside Chicago icon,
		activist, and one-time fraud convict Pastor T.L. Barrett into a
		gurgling trash compactor alongside some pigeon-cooed backing vocals
		and an entire undigested verse from another Future knockoff, Brooklyn
		upstart Desiigner. It's the least-finished-sounding piece of music to
		ever feature on a Kanye album. This is the logical endpoint to the
		sort of obsessive perfectionism that led West to make 75
		near-identical mix downs of &nbsp;"Stronger," and in the song's
		lyrics, Kanye admits that the same workaholism that made his father a
		distant figure in his childhood now keeps him from his family. On
		"FML," he name-checks the antidepressant Lexapro on record for
		the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP8FMdVcCQQ"
			target="_blank">second</a>time in a year, and alludes to something
		that sounds an awful lot like a manic episode. The life of a creative
		visionary has dark undercurrents ("name me one genius who ain't
		crazy," Kanye demands on "Feedback") and it's possible that&nbsp;<em>The
			Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;title serves as much private warning as boastful
		declaration.
	</p>
	<p>The album's most humane moments come when he reaches for his
		family: "I just want to wake up with you in my eyes," he pleads at the
		end of "Father Stretch My Hands." On "FML," a bleak song about
		resisting sexual temptation, he sings to Kim, "They don't want to see
		me love you." "Real Friends" reprises his "Welcome to Heartbreak" role
		as the unhappy outsider at his own family events, squirming through
		reunions and posing for pictures "before it's back to business"; it's
		maybe the saddest he's ever sounded on record.</p>
	<p>
		Tuning into the humanity in Kanye's music amid bursts of boorish
		static can be difficult, and the most prominent example of assholery
		on&nbsp;<em>Pablo</em>&nbsp;comes from the instantly infamous jab "I
		feel like me and Taylor might still have sex," which feels like a
		piece of bathroom graffiti made to purposefully reignite the most
		racially-charged rivalry in 21st-century pop. But there's lots more
		where that came from, sneaking in behind the headline: "If I fuck this
		model/ And she just bleached her asshole/ And I get bleach on my
		T-shirt/ I'mma feel like an asshole" is maybe the most unforgivably
		stupid thing Kanye West has ever rapped. And on the bonus track "30
		Hours," he takes a moment to sneer, "My ex said she gave me the best
		years of her life/ I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was
		right."
	</p>
	<p>
		At moments like this, you sense the airlessness of super-celebrity
		closing in around him. Even when he was being loathsome, Kanye's
		behavior always felt rooted in something messy and relatable. During
		the wild scrum of&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>'s press
		cycle&mdash;when he tweeted "I own your child!!" at Wiz Khalifa in
		response to a minor misunderstanding, or his "<a
			href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/697199554807099394?lang=en&amp;lang=en"
			target="_blank">BILL COSBY INNOCENT !!!!!!!!!!</a>" tweet,&nbsp;for
		instance&mdash;there was a prevailing sense that Kanye had entered
		such a consequence-free zone that we can never truly relate to him
		anymore. Once upon a time, he was The Asshole Incarnate, the
		self-described "douchebag" that we couldn't look away from. But there
		are moments here where he just sounds like another asshole.
	</p>
	<p>
		And yet, as it always does in Kanye's essentially crowd-pleasing,
		deeply Christian music, the light wins out over the darkness. A madcap
		sense of humor animates all his best work, and&nbsp;<em>The Life
			of Pablo</em>&nbsp;has a freewheeling energy that is infectious and unique
		to his discography. Somehow, it comes off as both his most
		labored-over and unfinished album, full of asterisks and corrections
		and&nbsp;<a
			href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698971890581401600"
			target="_blank">footnotes</a>. "It was my idea to have an open
		relationship, now a nigga mad," he jokes on "30 Hours," sending up his
		own masculine fragility. "I need every bad bitch up in Equinox/ I need
		to know right now if you a freak or not," he jokes on "Highlights."
	</p>
	<p>
		And with&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>, this humor isn't just in the
		verses, it's in the rollout, too. Somewhere between the record's
		several title changes, it started to feel like Kanye had decided to
		turn his troubled-blockbuster-syndrome into performance art. "We still
		don't have a title," Kim Kardashian tweeted, days before the announced
		rollout. The day after he rented out Madison Square Garden so he could
		plug in his laptop, it was suddenly unclear, again, if the album was
		coming out at all; the mess was so profound that a&nbsp;<a
			href="https://twitter.com/maura/status/698149518970327041"
			target="_blank">tweet</a>&nbsp;noting "Young Thug claimed on
		Periscope it was coming out on SNL tomorrow" suddenly seemed like
		solid intel. Chaos reigned, and as the twists and turns mounted, it
		was hard to keep from laughing helplessly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Around this point, the joke became clear: This whole thing&mdash;album
		cycles, first-week sales, release dates, the album-as-statement, the
		album itself&mdash;is&nbsp;<em>ridiculous</em>. The only other recent
		marquee star to allow something this messy to bear their name was
		Rihanna, whose&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21540-anti/"><em>ANTI</em></a>&nbsp;was
		released into the world last month in a similarly slipshod manner.
		Both stars are jewels in the late-period Roc-A-Fella dynasty, their
		careers forged in the dying embers of the old-school music industry
		where promotional campaigns were telegraphed months in advance, where
		singles and video rollouts were executed with airstrike precision,
		where release dates loomed like skyscrapers. In the ensuing industry
		freefall, Kanye and Rihanna have weathered every absurdity
		imaginable&mdash;platinum plaques handed out by Samsung,&nbsp;<a
			href="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/jay-z-and-kanye-west-spared-no-expense-to-watch-watch-the-throne-6624465"
			target="_blank">biometric suitcases carrying leakproof records</a>,
		artist-owned streaming services that put up their records for a few
		minutes by accident. Watching the sea of confusion and despair on news
		feeds and timelines, you can almost hear them chuckling:&nbsp;<em>None
			of this matters, because none of it is real.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		If there was a larger message behind all this impulsive last-second
		lurching and heaving, that was it. "We on an ultralight beam/ This is
		a God dream" reads like an affirmation that we live in a world touched
		by divinity&mdash;but it could also mean the universe is a trick of
		the light, and we're nothing but a figment in a higher being's
		imagination. Nothing is as it seems, nothing is safe from revision,
		and nothing lasts: In one last rug pull, Kanye claimed that the
		"Pablo" of the title was neither Escobar nor Picasso, but St. Paul of
		Tarsus ("Pablo" in Spanish). The claim slots neatly with his assertion
		that&nbsp;<em>The Life of Pablo</em>&nbsp;is a "gospel album," and on
		"Wolves," &nbsp;he offers a resonant, lonely image: Kim and Kanye as
		Mary and Joseph, alone in the manger and surrounded by the void.
		&nbsp;"Cover Nori in lamb's wool/ We surrounded by/ The fuckin
		wolves," he raps. If Pablo is indeed St. Paul, Kanye might have a
		passage on his mind from Corinthians, Chapter 13 verse 2: "If I have a
		faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing."
