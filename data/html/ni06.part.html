		In 2012&nbsp;<a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5921-skepta/">Skepta</a>&nbsp;found
		himself at an impasse. He was integral in grime&rsquo;s early
		hustle&nbsp;during the&nbsp;halcyon pirate radio days, but the music
		he was making, from 2008-2012 was soulless, kowtowing to a sanitized
		version of grime that went hand in hand with the slow-burning
		corporate ransacking of the genre that started with&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/1096-dizzee-rascal/">Dizzee
			Rascal</a>&rsquo;s breakthrough almost a decade earlier. He
		recently&nbsp;<a href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/skepta-dj-semtex"
			target="_blank">compared</a>&nbsp;this dissatisfaction with his role
		in the mainstream with Britney Spears' infamous shaved head incident.
		If there is a similar meltdown for Skepta it happened in April of
		2012, in a 26-minute video posted to Youtube, titled &ldquo;<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jOnj9I14hc" target="_blank">#UnderdogPsychosis
			no.1</a>&rdquo; with a caption that read: &ldquo;Break the cycle.&rdquo;
		In a monologue&nbsp;by turns manic, vulnerable, self-aware, and
		inarticulate, he castigated himself, the system, (in&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4873-dj-khaled/">DJ Khaled</a>&rsquo;s
		parlance the pervasive &ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/64029-dj-khaled-explains-the-keys-to-success-reveals-who-they-are-on-the-ellen-degeneres-show/">they</a>&rdquo;),
		the industry, reflected on his forgotten and youthful musical past,
		and celebrated the life of the underdog. He promised to make music
		that had meaning. The video was later shown at the Tate Modern, a
		strange high watermark for the grime renaissance he helped ignite.

		It&rsquo;s been five years since a proper studio album from the
		33-year-old Londoner, and after many delays his long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>&nbsp;has
		finally arrived. It is arguably the first appointment listen in a
		genre that has never been defined by albums, but by singles, loosies,
		hotly pressed riddims, and pirate radio broadcasts. This partly comes
		from an album roll out and rebranding that has lasted almost two
		years. Last April, he organized an impromptu rave in a Shoreditch car
		park attended by almost a thousand people via an Instagram post.
		He&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/58614-kanye-west-performs-all-day-at-the-brit-awards/">helped</a>&nbsp;hijack
		the stage of the Brits with&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>&nbsp;a
		month before. And even earlier than that&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/">Drake</a>&nbsp;had
		cribbed lines from Skepta&rsquo;s &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Not Me&rdquo;
		for &ldquo;Used To&rdquo; starting a cross-continental musical love
		affair, leading to Drake&nbsp;<a
			href="http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2016-05-09-drake-not-signed-bbk"
			target="_blank">symbolically</a>&nbsp;signing to Skepta&rsquo;s BBK
		label. He&rsquo;s helped unfurl a ocean-spanning red carpet
		that&rsquo;s led to wide ranging institutional support prompted
		magazine covers, documentaries, and a litany of think pieces asking,
		yet again, if was America ready for grime.
	</p>
	<p>
		The sudden explosion of cultural cachet seems to have made no dents
		in&nbsp;his anarchic attitude.&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>&nbsp;is easily
		the most blatantly anti-authoritarian statement from rap this year,
		overflowing with&nbsp;sneering contempt for popular culture&rsquo;s
		industry of image, the press, the police, and the government at large.
		&nbsp;No matter the respect he&rsquo;s garnered recently, and the
		friends he&rsquo;s gained along the way,&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>&nbsp;proves
		that Skepta still bristles at the very idea of institutions.
		He&nbsp;is still&nbsp;flipping the bird, compelling you to help him
		burn it all down.
	</p>
	<p>
		&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Not Me&rdquo; was the first song Skepta released
		off&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>, and it&rsquo;s a template for the
		album's tone: A combination of snarling bravado and earnest self
		directed criticism&mdash;an elegantly brutal volte-face from a
		previous life. He&rsquo;s thrown his designer clothes in the garbage,
		donned his famous black track suit, and disavowed the trappings of the
		last few years (&ldquo;I put it all in the bin cause that's not
		me&rdquo;). He&rsquo;s come back out of the thicket of a forced
		absence, full of self-aggrandizing swagger. (&ldquo;It's the return of
		the mack/I'm still alive just like 2Pac&rdquo;). &nbsp;A year later,
		at the height of his return to prominence, the music video for the
		best song on this album,&ldquo;Shutdown,&rdquo; was released. Dressed
		in all white, in the middle of London&rsquo;s bloated symbol of
		divisive gentrification the Barbican Centre, Skepta makes very clear
		that he fears no one: &ldquo;Me and my Gs ain't scared of police/We
		don't listen to no politician/Everybody on the same mission/We don't
		care about your &lsquo;isms and schisms," he rapped, lines that scan
		as both an indictment and a call-to-arms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Skepta&nbsp;produced eight of the twelve tracks himself, and they have
		the same roughly hewn power of his<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sVpRAllC4A" target="_blank">&nbsp;early
			instrumentals</a>, measured but fiery&nbsp;stews of dancehall, jungle, UK
		funky, and garage. When it works, it's bone-rattling stuff. Elsewhere,
		it's a mixed bag, sonically and qualitatively: He&nbsp;caricatures
		Noah &ldquo;40&rdquo; Shebib&rsquo;s rose-quartz soul on &ldquo;Ladies
		Hit Squad;&rdquo; &ldquo;Crime Riddim,&rdquo; produced by Blaikie and
		Skepta&rsquo;s brother Jason, has the wild flair of a&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/">Death
			Grips</a>&nbsp;track; and &ldquo;Numbers&rdquo; (featuring and
		co-produced by&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/">Pharrell</a>)
		fails to shoehorn Skepta into Pharrell's bubbly funk universe.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for his lyrics, there is nothing coded about them, or their
		meaning: He raps exclusively about distrust and independence.
		He&rsquo;s very much aware that London, and the world, will continue
		to exploit him and erase his individuality. This awareness is why he
		refuses to appear in pictures with fans or answer press emails in
		&ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18193-skepta-man/">Man</a>.&rdquo;
		It&rsquo;s why he pulls way back, and samples Wiley&rsquo;s call for
		peace in the middle of a battle (&ldquo;Lyrics for lyrics,
		calm&rdquo;) in &ldquo;Lyrics.&rdquo; He finds peace, if he finds it
		at all, in his roots: by &nbsp;remaining loyal to family and friends,
		by being appreciative of the past, and by incubating a future for his
		genre.&nbsp;<em>Konnichiwa</em>&nbsp;is as nakedly vulnerable Skepta
		has ever been, and it represents a tantalizingly wide-open door for
		grime. It&rsquo;ll be our job as listeners to step through and
		discover&nbsp;what we&rsquo;ve been missing.
