	<p>
		Scott&rsquo;s second studio album,&nbsp;<em>Birds in the Trap
			Sing McKnight</em>, is the Houston rapper&rsquo;s most concise and
		cohesive project to date. On last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21016-rodeo/"><em>Rodeo</em></a>,
		Scott struggled to balance ambition, quality, and star power. Songs
		ran much longer than they needed, letting the vibes simmer until you
		realized they were trite. Further, his production selection showed
		little growth from his largely self-produced 2013 debut&nbsp;<a
			href="https://soundcloud.com/travisscott-2/sets/owl-pharaoh"
			target="_blank"><em>Owl Pharaoh</em></a>, and its well-received
		follow-up mixtape&nbsp;<a
			href="https://soundcloud.com/travisscott-2/sets/days-before-rodeo"
			target="_blank"><em>Days Before Rodeo</em></a>. Both those tapes
		featured a recognizable &ldquo;Travis Scott Sound&rdquo;&mdash;an even
		larger, even more gothic take on Lex Luger&rsquo;s trap anthems.&nbsp;<em>Rodeo</em>&nbsp;simply
		amped up the grandeur with little substance or variation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Scott remains committed to his signature sound on&nbsp;<em>Birds</em>&nbsp;but
		has finally made small tweaks to make it his own. Most Travis Scott
		songs sound very&nbsp;<em>serious</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Birds</em>&nbsp;finds
		him at his most melodramatic. Even the peak ridiculous moments
		on&nbsp;<em>Birds</em>&nbsp;are delivered with a completely straight
		face. On &ldquo;through the late night,&rdquo; he utters,
		&ldquo;Relieve my heart of malice,&rdquo; but offers no reason why
		that may be necessary. Because he does not provide great detail or
		context as to why he&rsquo;s in dire need of salvation, it comes off
		as both grandiose and vacuous, which, at best, is just really fun to
		listen to. His apocalyptic vanity is less high art than it is camp,
		but his commitment is similar to&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/">Lana Del
			Rey</a>&rsquo;s high-stakes ennui ballads on&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19449-lana-del-rey-ultraviolence/"><em>Ultraviolence</em></a>,
		or all of the soapy affairs across&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/">David
			Lynch</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twin Peaks.
	</p>
	<p>
		The use of synthetic sound curios across *Birds *also help define this
		world, this pre-fab movie studio lot where Scott&rsquo;s antics start
		to make more sense. The production across&nbsp;<em>Birds</em>&rsquo;
		14 tracks is as big and important as any across Scott&rsquo;s
		discography, but every outsourced producer here creates something
		bespoke to Scott&rsquo;s developing aesthetic, with at least one alien
		soundbite making an otherwise conventional beat something special.
		&ldquo;sweet sweet,&rdquo; for example, opens with a glossy noise
		recalling&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hxVQ9rhjyTY?t=18s"
			target="_blank">mid-2000s AIM sound effects</a>&nbsp;and the standout
		&ldquo;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/news/67524-watch-travis-scott-young-thug-quavos-explicit-pick-up-the-phone-video/">pick
			up the phone</a>&rdquo; features a hollowed-out synth that sounds like
		it&rsquo;s been digitized 10 times over. The latter culminates with
		that effect turned into a beautiful glissando that cuts off abruptly.
		Better to do more with less than try to pack as many flourishes as
		possible onto one track.
	</p>
	<p>The two main criticisms that have followed Scott his entire
		career are that he doesn&rsquo;t rap about anything, and when he does
		rap, he doesn&rsquo;t do it well. It&rsquo;s easy to tell when Travis
		Scott is &ldquo;trying to rap,&rdquo; as on album opener &ldquo;the
		ends,&rdquo; because he really turns down the Auto-Tune. And when
		given too much time on the mic, Scott reverts to bad hashtag rapper.
		But when the verses are short, he offers, at the very least,
		intriguing bits of imagery: spending &ldquo;a Sunday morning in a
		brothel,&rdquo; or lacking cell &ldquo;service in the
		mountains.&rdquo; The scenes never materialize into anything, but they
		help decorate an album and keep the artificial stakes high and the
		energy up.</p>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s also telling that each major guest highlights a key
		component that Scott lacks.&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/">Andr&eacute;
			3000</a>, delivering a new trap flow, paints a vivid picture on
		&ldquo;the ends.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/">Kendrick
			Lamar</a>&nbsp;puts on a technical clinic, annunciating and shifting
		pitches on &ldquo;goosebumps.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33863-21-savage/">21 Savage</a>is
		plainspoken, straightforward, and fierce on &ldquo;outside.&rdquo; On
		&ldquo;pick up the phone,&rdquo; Quavo even delivers the titular
		&ldquo;Birds in the Trap Sing Brian McKnight.&rdquo; Despite even more
		vocal contributions from&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/">the Weeknd</a>,&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/">Young Thug</a>,&nbsp;<a

			Beatz</a>,&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33765-bryson-tiller/">Bryson
			Tiller</a>, and others, Travis Scott remains at the center because
		he&rsquo;s finally found his calling. He&rsquo;s no longer a biter or
		an up-and-coming protege or an industry plant. He&rsquo;s the rich and
		often ineffectual host of the party, overlooking the grounds from his
		dubious veranda, here to make sure everyone comes in and goes out
		looking and sounding spectacular. He has always been a mood-setter and
		a vocalist, and he is in full command of the vibe, tone, and mood of
		this entire project more than ever.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&rsquo;s a triumph that Travis Scott sources from different parts to
		turn&nbsp;<em>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</em>&nbsp;into his
		unified vision. The&nbsp;<a
			href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ1hvYHDjwU/" target="_blank">cover
			art</a>(shot by&nbsp;<a href="http://nickknight.com/" target="_blank">Nick
			Knight</a>) shows Scott as something between a bird, a fallen angel, and
		a video game character&mdash;his eyes pure white with plumes of
		equally white smoke rising above. It&rsquo;s a ridiculous image to
		cover an album that includes a song called &ldquo;beibs in the
		trap&rdquo;&mdash;a misspelling of&nbsp;<a
			href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33315-justin-bieber/">Justin
			Bieber</a>&nbsp;as slang for cocaine&mdash;but that&rsquo;s the point.
		Travis Scott repurposes conventional subjects and sounds, making them
		compelling with his panache. Like his mentor, he seems keenly aware of
		his place in the genre. At one point, he literally says, &ldquo;Shout
		my tropes!&rdquo; By and large, the whole record is about rampant drug
		abuse, yet he transcends the rote topic with how forcefully and
		pompously he indulges.&nbsp;<em>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</em>&nbsp;escapes
		as Travis Scott&rsquo;s best work yet: a combination of elevated
		significance, self-awareness, and the old trick of spinning something
		so plain into something so luxurious.
