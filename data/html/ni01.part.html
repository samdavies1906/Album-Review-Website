	<p>You can mock his fans&rsquo; bragging about the
		&ldquo;purity&rdquo; of his achievements if you want, but
		there&rsquo;s also a sense in which Cole has become famous by doing
		exactly the opposite of virtually every other major contemporary
		hip-hop artist. Their albums sprawl towards the hour-and-a-half-mark,
		stuffed with appearances by special guests that sometimes seem to
		speak less of artistic fraternity and more of ensuring every
		commercial base is covered. His have increasingly clocked in at a
		crisp, old-fashioned 45 minutes.</p>
	<p>As if to underline that J Cole albums come free of padding,
		KOD&rsquo;s most emotionally impactful lyrics are on tracks labelled
		as interludes and outros, words that normally guarantee you
		won&rsquo;t miss much if you hit fast-forward. Not here. The interlude
		Once an Addict turns out to be a heartbreaking, unsparing examination
		of his mother&rsquo;s alcoholism and Cole&rsquo;s own inability to
		intervene or help. The outro Window Pain concerns a child Cole met
		through his not-for-profit organisation the Dreamville Foundation, who
		attempted to make sense of her cousin&rsquo;s shooting by suggesting
		it was all part of God&rsquo;s masterplan, a signal that Jesus was
		coming back &ldquo;so we can rejoice with him and have our
		time&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>Nor does Cole much bother with the kind of hook-laden banger
		guaranteed to ensure radio play and crossover pop success. Like its
		2016 predecessor, 4 Your Eyez Only, the music on KOD is sparse and
		understated: even its most uptempo track, ATM, is set to muted, jazzy
		piano chords, while listeners of a certain vintage might find the term
		&ldquo;trip-hop&rdquo; springing to mind unbidden when the meandering
		guitar and vibraphone sample of Brackets slouch into life.</p>
	<p>KOD&rsquo;s sound exists in a curious, appealing area somewhere
		between beatifically stoned and slightly unsettling. Motiv8 revolves
		around little more than an eerie keyboard figure and a disembodied cry
		of &ldquo;get money&rdquo; from Lil Kim&rsquo;s guest appearance on
		the 1995 Junior MAFIA hit of the same title &ndash; ripped out of
		context, it sounds bleak and despairing &ndash; and there&rsquo;s
		something really haunting about Photograph, with its delicate two-note
		guitar sample and a chorus whose vocal appears to be slightly out of
		step with the beat.</p>
	<p>
		This is an album on which Cole sets himself up as the conscience of
		mainstream hip hop &ndash; the goofy, self-deprecating humour of his
		2014 single Wet Dreamz and the warm contentment of Foldin&rsquo;
		Clothes are both conspicuous by their absence. Instead, we find Cole
		repeatedly raising a concerned eyebrow at drug use in the world
		of&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" draggable="true"

			data-link-name="in body link">Xanax-fuelled rap</a>&nbsp;and probing
		hip-hop&rsquo;s obsession with money. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing
		that could come off a little preachy but it doesn&rsquo;t here,
		largely because Cole is always quick to implicate himself. He has, he
		claims, &ldquo;sipped so much Actavis I convinced Actavis that they
		should pay me&rdquo;; while on ATM, he&rsquo;s as guilty as anyone of
		allowing his wealth to define his self-worth. He&rsquo;s also very
		good at unexpectedly flipping the script midway through a track.
		Brackets starts out sounding troublingly like a rich man moaning about
		having to pay tax, but ends up somewhere very different: an indictment
		of the inherent racism of US government spending.
	</p>
	<p>But KOD&rsquo;s best track may be its closer, 1985, which is
		billed as a taster of his forthcoming project The Fall Off. It
		delivers hip-hop&rsquo;s new generations of artists (by whom Cole is
		&ldquo;unimpressed&rdquo;) a wise, warm but firm talking-to that
		switches from practical advice, warnings about the fleeting nature of
		fame and the inadvisability of jumping on trends to a stark and
		impressively incisive suggestion they should think hard about the
		nature of their appeal: &ldquo;These white kids love that you
		don&rsquo;t give a fuck, &lsquo;cause that&rsquo;s exactly
		what&rsquo;s expected when your skin black&hellip; They wanna be black
		and think your song is how it feels&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s clearly the stuff of which vast controversy is made
		&ndash; you can see the headlines about the rappers it&rsquo;s
		addressing &ldquo;clapping back&rdquo; as it plays. But like the rest
		of KOD, it leaves you very eager to see where J Cole goes next.</p>
